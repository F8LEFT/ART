How to build:

Before building this project, you must conform that you have installed
the latest Qt program(Qt5.7) and cmake.

git clone https://github.com/F8LEFT/ART

cd ART

mkdir build

cd build

export $PATH=/directory/to/qmake:$PATH

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=STRING=Release -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:STRING=/path/to/qmake  --build ..

make ART

Or just use QtCreator to build it. Use QtCreator to open ${ART}/CmakeLists.txt, and build.

build file will be found in CMAKE_BUILD/bin.

Ps: If you are building ART in Windows Platform, you need to generate dependency
file after building. Just open Qt Mingw, then change root directory to ./bin.
Use windeployqt to generate it.

windeployqt --release ART.exe
