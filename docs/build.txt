How to build:

Before building this project, you must conform that you have installed
the latest Qt program(Qt5.7) and cmake.

git clone https://github.com/F8LEFT/ART

cd ART

mkdir build

cd build

git submodule init

git submodule update

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DQTGCCDIR=${QTGCCDIR} -D[WIN32|APPLE|UNIX]=1 --build ..

make MainWindow

You can see generated files in lib/gui/bin.
QTGCCDIR is the compile toolkit path from qt.
In Linux, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/gcc_64
In Mac, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/clang_64
In Windows, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/mingw53_32

or use QtCreator to build file.

Open QtCreator.

File -> Open File or Project -> choose CmakeList.txt in ART project root.

Projects -> Setting ->
set Boolean : YAML_CPP_BUILD_CONTRIB:OFF YAML_CPP_BUILD_TOOLS:OFF
Add Boolean : [WIN32|APPLE|UNIX]:ON

build RELEASE version.

generated files can be found in lib/gui/bin.

Ps: If you are building ART in Windows Platform, you need to generate dependency
file after building. Just open Qt Mingw, then change root directory to ./lib/gui/bin.
Use windeployqt to generate it.

windeployqt --release MainWindow.exe
