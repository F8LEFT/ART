How to build:

Before building this project, you must conform that you have installed
the latest Qt program(Qt5.7) and cmake.

git clone https://github.com/F8LEFT/ART

cd ART

mkdir build

cd build

git submodule init

git submodule update

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DQTGCCDIR=${QTGCCDIR} -D[WIN32|APPLE|UNIX]=1 --build ..

make MainWindow

You can see generated files in lib/gui/bin.
QTGCCDIR is the compile toolkit path from qt.
In Linux, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/gcc_64
In Mac, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/clang_64
In Windows, it means ${QTINSTALL}/5.7/mingw53_32
