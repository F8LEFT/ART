How to build:

Before building this project, you must conform that you have installed
the latest Qt program(Qt5.7), java and cmake.

git clone https://github.com/F8LEFT/ART

cd ART

mkdir build

cd build

export PATH=/directory/to/qmake:/path/to/java:$PATH

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=STRING=Release  --build ..

make ART

Or just use QtCreator to build it. Use QtCreator to open ${ART}/CmakeLists.txt, and build.

build file will be found in CMAKE_BUILD/bin.

Ps: If you are building ART in Windows Platform, you need to generate dependency
file after building.

windeployqt --release ART.exe
