# Rebase a27a854..0b703a3 onto a27a854 (13 command(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message

#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
